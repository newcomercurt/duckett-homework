    <!--Modify #3 to use jQuery's .ajax() to load myData.json, instead of using .getJSON(). Pay attention to the pieces of
    code you need to make .ajax() behave like .getJSON().[+1 E.C.] Extend #3 to include a <button>, and change F to not call
    P, but register P as an event handler of the <button>. Verify that a button click causes data from myData.json to be printed.

[+1 E.C.] Modify #3 to include a <button> and move the entire .getJSON() code into a 'click' event handler for the <button>.
Verify that a button click causes data from myData.json to be printed.
[+1 E.C.] Explain how #5 differs from #6. If the user clicks the button many times, which solution is better, and why?
Discuss
In your own words, how do AJAX and JSON relate to each other? What is one question you have from the reading?-->
