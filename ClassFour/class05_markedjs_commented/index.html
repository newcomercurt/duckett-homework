<!--[1 points] Comment on five features you noticed about the app during UI sandboxing.
Which one did you like best, and why? Again, submit this item as a comment for your PR, not in Canvas. In Canvas, submit only the URLs of your PRs.

While sandboxing this, I found my favorite feature was using the ```as an opening tag and ``` to
close the tag as doing so allowed me to write a block of code without having to do four spaces every time
I wrote code on a different line. After the opening ``` you have to specify the language you are using. so ```html
will render markup in html and ```js will do the same for javascript. I noticed that when I put text that did not have
an open or closing tag the json and raw html renderings automatically put the input text into a <p></p> element.
Feature three that I noticed was how the underscore made the text as italic and the html and json displays both recognized that.
The fourth feature I liked was how an unorganized list could be simply created using an asterisk. The fifth thing I liked about
markdown was the fact that it is easy to write content and have it appear in dom immediately.

Analyze the app's code and write comments in the code itself (submit a PR for your commented code) that address
the following items. Each item below is worth [1 point], except for the first one, which you may answer for your own enjoyment.

What are the units of measure for the values of the "rows" and "cols" attributes of <textarea>?

The units of measure are ems for the "rows" and "cols"

What is purpose of line index.html:64? i.e.,
  hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();

The purpose of this tag is to link to the highlight library.

What happens if you move it one line up in the HTML file? Two lines up?

*One line up it will still do live markup but it will not make code blocks.
Two lines up also will not make any code blocks and the console will throw
an error that hljs is not defined.


In line render.js:14, what does pMarkOut.find('pre code') do? What are "pre" and "code"?
This code finds the code between the pre and code tags and it highlights the code. Pre and code are tags.

In render.js:15, what does
  hljs.highlightBlock(block) return, and how is the returned value used by the rest of the code?

This highlights the code within the given element. The result is code that looks like its in an editor being displayed.

Explain lines render.js:21 and render.js:22 at the detailed level (where you break down each variable and method)
and explain how they affect what a user sees in the webpage.
Line 21 sets the mobj object to have the json output. Line 22 takes the pJson object which is assigned the to pJson element
with the id of pJson and it stringifys the text content. This wil display json on the page.

Do JSON, HTML raw, and HTML rendered outputs change when you type a single character? Why/why not?
Yes they do change after typing a single character as the render function is set to run everytime there is any input.
What line(s) of code are responsible for causing the outputs to be updated?
The line responsible is line 26 as it runs the function everytime there is a change. 

[1 point] each:

1. Write your own app from scratch that lets the user enter text (you can use <textarea>, <select>, etc.), and covert that text to HTML, with proper handling (conversion) of any markdown contained in that text, and render the HTML.

2. Add a button that, when clicked, causes user-entered text to be converted to HTML (with proper markdown handling) and appends the HTML to the DOM. Repeated clicks of the button will cause repeated copies to be appended.

<h3>Raw markdown w/ content. Edit this!</h3>
<!-- Pre-load text area with "marked down" content -->
<textarea rows="20" cols="60" id="tBody" class="pCommon pRaw">
Plain text<br>

<span style="color:green; padding:2px; display:inline-block; border:1px green solid">GGG</span>
<span style="color:blue; padding:2px">BBB</span>

    // For automatic synatx highlighting:
    //   1. Write a code block
    //   2. Put an empty line above the block
    //   3. Indent the block by four spaces.

    // Example code block:
    function render() {
      var bodVal = tBody.val(); // Raw article markup
      var m = marked(bodVal); // Convert markup to html
      $(m).filter('pre').each(function(i, block) { hljs.highlightBlock(block); });
