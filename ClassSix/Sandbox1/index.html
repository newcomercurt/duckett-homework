[+3.5 max, + 1 E.C.] Items 1 thru 7 below total to 5.5 points. You are asked to pick at least "3.5 points' worth"
of items and write one sandbox app for each item you picked. For example, you can pick items 3 thru 6 below, or
items 1 thru 5, or items 1, 3, 6, 7, etc. and would receive full credit. If you do all items in 1 thru 7, you'll still earn 3.5 points.
You can extra credit for this section by only by doing item 8.

[+1] A higher order function (HOF) that has a function F as a parameter, and calls F. Let F accept one parameter.
Your app should call the HOF.
